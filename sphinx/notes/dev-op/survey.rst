Semantic Dev-op White Paper
---------------------------

About
=====

*Semantic Dev-op* is a concept, a dev-op service, supporting semantics built upon
online platforms that will faciliate developement of enterprise information
systems based on relational databases, with an explicit semantics layer and some
tools or infrastructures such as relational database synchronizers, 3D model
generators and renderer, etc, to influent developers or engineers to build their
solutions attributing to a imaginary commnity, a sublime concept,  the common data
sharing behaviour, which is solidfied by activities in the mundane, like service
API exposeing and sharing or integrating, etc.

The Take Aways
==============

* An imaginary data community (baring data sharing in mind)

Users (developers) are intended to publish their results to be reused somewhere else,
which behaviour is verified in the open source commnity. Another stronger evidence is
already exists for a long, the imaginary political community. The platform provide some
basic modules and runtime environment for a limited industrial section, helping them
to sandardize and scale-up, by building applications on a common data sharing platform.

Changing the engineering process itself is actually the standardization.

Decompositing the Concept
=========================

Using semantics layer to facilitate, change users and engineers' behaviours
___________________________________________________________________________

That is, a backend infrastructure with relational databases and services to
speed up application development and deployment.

Hopefully with previous works on Semantic-\*, developers can directly publish a
prototype system quickly without modifying a line of code, of cause, with an
extensive work for an overhaul.

The backend developing process at the first step now is:

* Data module design
* Service architecture planning
* Data service exposing policy
* Business intelligence with traffic surveying and analyzing
* Having available data service visualized at design time.

Works to be done:
_________________

* A VS Code plugin for browsing available exposed data service Backend data synchronizer
* A VS Code database designer and a Java data service module compiler
* A platform for experiment and deploy docker images
* A paid cloud / edge runtime environment
* A consulting service for data planning and integration or data quality verifying

Front end online modules to support this
________________________________________

* JS/TS widgets library, e.g. Anclient.js + Anprism, for online frontend page
  designing, opening and verifying.

* Various plugins for Blender, Ravit, UE, etc., to access online data while
  creating 3D scenarios. A WebGL runtime for testing exported 3D scenes and
  for integrating in frontend pages

Who will like this?
===================

Commnities where data have close semantic relationship, e. g. giant organizations
who build and extend their service upon each other, but difficult to plan an
enterprise wide data bus.

A gas and oil company can be such a good example, of which their departments,
engineering, analysing, etc., are depending on each other's data services.
