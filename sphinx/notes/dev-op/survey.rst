Semantic Dev-op White Paper
---------------------------

About
=====

*Semantic Dev-op* is a concept, a dev-op service, supporting semantics built upon
online platforms that will facilitate development of enterprise information
systems based on relational databases, with an explicit semantics layer and some
tools or infrastructures such as relational database synchronizers, 3D model
generators and renderer, etc, to influent developers or engineers to build their
solutions attributing to an imaginary community, a sublime concept,  the common data
sharing behaviour, which is solidified by activities in the mundane, like service
API exposing and sharing or integrating, etc.

The Take Aways
==============

* An imaginary data community (baring data sharing in mind)

Users (developers) are intended to publish their results to be reused somewhere
else, which behaviour is verified in the open source community. Another stronger
evidence has already being exist for a long time, the imaginary political
community. The platform provides some basic modules and runtime environment for
a limited industrial section, helping them to standardize and scale-up, by
building applications on a common data sharing platform.

Changing the engineering behaviour itself is actually the standardization.

Decompositing the Concept
=========================

The Strategy
____________

*Using a semantics layer to facilitate and change users or engineers' behaviours.*
   
That is, a backend infrastructure with relational databases and services to
speed up application development and deployment, and multiple frontends for
presenting, integrating data in business view.

Hopefully with previous works on Semantic-\*, developers can directly publish a
prototype system quickly without modifying a line of code, of course, with some
extensive work for an overhaul.

The backend developing process at the first step now is:
________________________________________________________

* Data module design
* Service architecture planning
* Data service exposing policy
* Business intelligence with traffic surveying and analyzing
* Having available data service visualized at design time.

Works to be done:

* A VS Code plugin for browsing available exposed data service Backend data synchronizer
* A VS Code database designer and a Java data service module compiler
* A platform for experiment and deploy docker images
* A paid cloud / edge runtime environment
* A consulting service for data planning and integration or data quality verifying

Front end online modules to support this
________________________________________

* JS/TS widgets library, e.g. Anclient.js + Anprism, for online frontend page
  designing, opening and verifying.

* Various plugins for Blender, Ravit, UE, etc., to access online data while
  creating 3D scenarios. A WebGL runtime for testing exported 3D scenes and
  for integrating in frontend pages

Who will like this?
===================

Communities where data have close semantic relationships, e. g. giant
organizations who build and extend their service upon each other, sharing common
business achievements, but it is difficult to plan an enterprise-wide data bus
service.

A typical gas and oil company can be such a good example, of which their
departments, engineering, analysing, etc., are depending on each other's data
services, while everyone needs their special knowledge for optimization locally.
