    Which one should you use?

    Use COLMAP if you want the most "realistic" and accurate 3D model of
    a scene for mapping, autonomous driving, or visualization.

    Use OpenMVG if you are an engineer or researcher who needs to extract
    the specific mathematical relationship between cameras or if you want
    to modify the internal matching algorithms for a custom project.
