About
=====

Portfolio is a system for manage, synchronizing personal documents, including an
Android client App and a server node.

Protfolio is currently a demo version. Users must take care of their files
uploaded to the server, usually a personal computer.

About Volume
------------

A volume is a folder within the server's file system, which is specified by the user
while setting up the service node. uploaded files and data are saved here.

.. warning::

    Don't change data in the volume folder. Moving, modification of files
    will cause unspecified results.

Also, do not switch volume to another location although in v 0.7.0 the service can
still run.
