Quick Start
===========

Prerequisit
-----------

The Portfolio Android client must run with a server which is usually deployed as
a family file server. This server must be installed on a personal computer
(requires Python 3.9 and JDK 17).

The server program, Portfolio Synode,
`jserv-album-0.7.#.zip <https://github.com/odys-z/semantic-jserv/releases/tag/portfolio-synode-0.7.0>`_
is released as an excutable on Python 3 and JDK 17.

See :ref:`How to setup Portfolio Synode <setup-synode>`, the private file server.
