Troubleshootings
================

Some videos are not showing
---------------------------

The most likely reason for this is the video codec is not supported by the Android version.
E.g. Portfolio on Ahndord 10, Hhuawei H30, cannot show codec of hvc1, which is working once
the video is converted to h.264.

Is not recommended to convert the codec, but to use a updated web browser to open the home page.
A better solution will come in the future.
