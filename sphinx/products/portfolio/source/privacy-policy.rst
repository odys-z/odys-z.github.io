========================

**Last Updated: March 05, 2025**

    Product: Portfolio 0.7, Demo Version (Ads Supported)

This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with
how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII,
as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can
be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a
single person, or to identify an individual in context.

Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we
collect, use, protect or otherwise handle user's Personally Identifiable Information
in accordance with our apps.

What personal information do we collect from the people using Portfolio?

When installing Family Album Synchronizer, as appropriate, you may be asked to
allow Portfolio to have the permissions to access user's audio record, external
storage or other details to help you synchronize (upload) user's files to the
file server.

Portfolio has no plan to use third party services, e.g. Google's Advertising
and Google Analytics.

We want to inform users of this application that user's Personal Information will
not be used anywhere except for managing files at server.

AdMob & AdSense advertising requirements can be summed up by AdMob & AdSense
advertising principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience
for users.

Log Data
--------

We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in the case of an error
in the app we collect data and information (through third party products) on user's
phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as the user's
device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
configuration of the app when utilizing Service, the time and date of user's use of
the Service, and other statistics.

Does Protfolio use 'cookies'?
-----------------------------

Portfolio for Android & Windows does not use cookies in any case.

Portfolio shared files can be browsed with web browsers, which will use cookies
for identifying logged users. The data is handled at client side, no transmission
on network, and no further usages.

EXIF & Geolocation
------------------

EXIF is metadata of media files.

When each media file is uploaded to the family file server, the server will try to
parse the EXIF data, and geolocation data are parsed and saved in databases. 
When a user shares photos, the geolocations are also accessible to other users.

If the file doesn't have geolocation data in the EXIF section, no geolocation is
saved, and the user's current location is not be accessed, hence the geolocation
data is not always guaranteed to be parsed correctly.

This function is designed to support photo grouping according to geolocation.

Safeguards and Third-party disclosure
-------------------------------------

Portfolio gets reports from the third part services regularly, includes Google Play
& Admob.

The support team of Portfolio do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside
parties Personal Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice.

We may release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the
law, enforce our app policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or
safety.

However, non-personally identifiable user information may be provided to other
parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

- **Important**:
  
  All uploaded files are sent to a server that you, the user, own and set up.
  We do not store, process, or access your files on our own servers or systems.
  We do not sell, trade, or share your data with third parties, except as
  required by law.

    data only with the format of Portfolio Demo. Only server address is added as
    a new option. Other data won't be saved for any uses.

    By granting camera permission, you agree to allow the app to use this feature as described.
