Portfolio Privacy Policy
========================

**Last Updated: March 04, 2025**

We value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Portfolio Demo we collects, uses,
and protects your information when you use our app.

Information We Collect
----------------------

We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our app’s functionality:  

- **Network Information**:
 
  We access your device’s internet connection and network state to enable file uploads and ensure
  the app works properly.  

- **Media and Files**:
  
  With your permission, we access audio, images, videos, and other files stored on your device
  (via external storage or media libraries) to allow you to upload and manage them.  

  No personally identifiable information is collected unless you explicitly provide it to us.

How We Use Your Information
---------------------------

The information we collect is used to:  

- Enable the core feature of collecting local files and media from your device and uploading them to a server you own and configure, so you can manage your documents on your PC.  

- Ensure the app connects to the internet and functions as intended.  

- Improve app performance and troubleshoot issues.  

- **Important**:
  
  All uploaded files are sent to a server that you, the user, own and set up. We do not store,
  process, or access your files on our own servers or systems. We do not sell, trade, or share
  your data with third parties, except as required by law.

Permissions
-----------

Portfolio Demo requests the following permissions:  

- **Internet:**

  To upload files to your designated server.  

- **Access Network State:**

  To check your network connection for optimal performance.  

- **Read External Storage / Media:**

  To read audio, image, video, and other files from your device for uploading and management.  

- **Camera Permission:**

    Portfolio Demo requests access to your device's camera to provide QR code recognition,
    which is used for adding server address. We are committed to protecting your privacy
    and ensuring that your personal information is handled responsibly. Below is how we
    use and manage camera access:

    - **Purpose:**

    The camera permission is used solely for QR code scanning.

    - **Data Collection:**

    When you grant camera access, the app may capture QR Code images, and use the data only
    with the format of Portfolio Demo. Only server address is added as a new option.
    Other data won't be saved for any uses.

    By granting camera permission, you agree to allow the app to use this feature as described.
    If you have any concerns or questions about how your data is used, please refer to our full
    Privacy Policy or contact us.


These permissions are necessary for the app to work as intended. You can manage permissions through your device settings.

Data Security
-------------

Your files are uploaded directly to the server you configure. We take reasonable steps to protect the app’s functionality
and your connection to your server, but we are not responsible for the security of your server or the files stored there.
No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of data in transit.

Changes to This Policy
----------------------

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected here with an updated "Last Updated" date.
Please review this policy periodically.
