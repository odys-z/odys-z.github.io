About Camera Permission
----------------------- 

Portfolio Demo requests access to your device's camera to provide QR code recognition,
which is used for adding server address. We are committed to protecting your privacy
and ensuring that your personal information is handled responsibly. Below is how we
use and manage camera access:

- Purpose:

  The camera permission is used solely for QR code scanning.

- Data Collection:

  When you grant camera access, the app may capture QR Code images, and use the data only
  with the format of Portfolio Demo. Only server address is added as a new option.
  Other data won't be saved for any uses.

- User Control:

  You can enable or disable camera access at any time through your device settings.
  No camera data is accessed without your explicit consent.

- Security:
  
  Any data captured via the camera is protected to prevent unauthorized access.

- Third-Party Sharing:
  
  We do not share camera-captured data with third parties, except with your explicit consent.

By granting camera permission, you agree to allow the app to use this feature as described.
If you have any concerns or questions about how your data is used, please refer to our full
Privacy Policy or contact us.
