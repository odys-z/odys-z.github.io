The Android Image Pikcker cannot tag All prevouslly selected images.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Description**: The Android Image Picker cannot tag all previously selected images.

When the user selects multiple images and click *Done*, return to the picker before
uploading finished, some images are not tagged because the server has no record of them.

This will be correctly displayed when return to the picker after uploading finished.
