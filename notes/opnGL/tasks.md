# Readings:

DONE. [Chris Wellons, A GPU Approach to Particle Physics](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/29/)

Tips from this article:

1. It's using texture as normals' data.

2. The encoder / decoder showing some tricks of using textrue data

DONE [Chris Wellons, A GPU Approach to Path Finding](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/22/)

1. Using state cell rather than A* for path finding algorithm.

2. Can be improved with some block finding first? Or can we port Open Steer to GPU?
