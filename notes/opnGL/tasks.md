# Readings:


## GPU Caculation

DONE. [A GPU Approach to Conway's Game of Life](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/10/)

Tips from this article:

1. Use buffered rendering and webgl glReadPixel() for getting results.

DONE. [Chris Wellons, A GPU Approach to Particle Physics](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/29/)

1. It's using texture as normals' data.

2. The encoder / decoder showing some tricks of using textrue data.

3. Using textrue2D() in vertex shader.

DONE [Chris Wellons, A GPU Approach to Path Finding](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/22/)

1. Using state cell rather than A* for path finding algorithm.

2. Can be improved with some block finding first? Or can we port Open Steer to GPU?
